Feature: Creating and fetching a customer

  Scenario: Creating a new customer
    Given I pipe contents of file ./fixtures/customer.json to body
    And I set Content-Type header to application/json
    When I POST to /customers
    Then response code should be 201
    And response header location should exist
    And I store the value of response header location as location in global scope

  Scenario: retrieving a customer based on id
    When I GET `location`
    Then response code should be 200
    And response body should be valid according to schema file ./fixtures/customer.schema.json
